    These segmentations can be carried out by expect in the field. however, it can lead to human error, biased decision and time consuming. Hence, it best to automate this process by desinging a customer segmentation system.

Objective:
- to develop a clustering algorithm that estimate credit card customer segmentation to help the company define the best marketing strategy

Dataset:
The sample Dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months.
The file is at a customer level with 18 behavioral variables.

Procedures:
-visualized the dataset to find the relationship between the features
-normalized the dataset 
-performed Dimension reduction using Principal Component analysis
-used the elbow method to determine the k value
-determined the best silhoutte score
-created cluster visulaizations

prerequisite:
jupyter notebook
python
numpy
pandas
